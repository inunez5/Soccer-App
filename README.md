This Flask application displays soccer player statistics, allows the user to view all players, and compare two players side-by-side. The app includes three primary routes:

Home Page – shows total goals, total assists, and featured players

Players Page – displays a table of all players from a JSON dataset

Compare Page – allows users to compare two selected players' stats

This project was created as part of a Capstone assignment requiring multiple Flask applications and the use of Generative AI to aid with development.
